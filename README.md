# Password Strength Checker

A simple Python script that checks the strength of a given password and provides feedback and suggestions for improvement.

## 🚀 Features
- Evaluates password length, complexity, and character variety
- Checks for common weak patterns (e.g., "123", "password")
- Rates password as **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**
- Provides actionable suggestions

## 🧪 Usage

```bash
python password_checker.py
```

## 🧰 Example

```
Enter your password: pass123

Password Strength: Weak
Suggestions:
- Make the password at least 8 characters long.
- Use both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Add special characters like @, #, $, etc.
```

## 📦 Requirements

- No external libraries required

## 🔐 Security Note
This script does not store or transmit any passwords. It's a standalone local tool for educational purposes.

## 🧠 Future Enhancements
